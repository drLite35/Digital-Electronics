## Introduction

In the Digital Design Lab, you will be working on various digital circuits to understand fundamental concepts of digital electronics and logic design. This repository is designed to help you organize, store, and share your circuit designs and simulations throughout the course.

Key features of this repository:

- **Structured Organization:** Circuits are organized into folders, making it easy to locate specific projects and associated files.

- **Version Control:** Git version control is used to track changes in your circuit designs, enabling collaboration and easy experimentation.

- **Simulation:** You can simulate your circuits using a digital circuit simulator of your choice (e.g., Logisim, Digital Works,Verilog ,  etc.).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start using this repository, make sure you have the following:

1. **Git:** Version control system software. Download and install from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Digital Circuit Simulator:** Choose a simulator that you'll use to design and simulate your circuits (e.g., Logisim, Digital Works, etc.). Install the simulator on your computer.

### Installation
